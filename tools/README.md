Keys not in our lookup tables will show as `UNKNOWN` with their key code for identification.

## Exit Methods

All tools support multiple exit methods:
- **ESC key**
- **Ctrl+C** 
- **CMD+Q** (macOS)

## Development Notes

- Tools use the local `../src/index` import to test the current development version
- All tools include proper cleanup and terminal restoration
- Color output is optimized for both light and dark terminals
- Table formatting automatically adjusts to terminal width
